Overview
Before we go into detail about artificial neural network, we should try to imagine how biological neural network works.
A biological neural network is composed of a groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons.
A single neuron may be connected to many other neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may be extensive. 
Connections, called synapses, are usually formed from axons to dendrites, though dendrodendritic synapses and other connections are possible.
Apart from the electrical signaling, there are other forms of signaling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion.

A neural network is a network or circuit of biological neurons, or, in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.
Thus, a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, used for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems.

Now, the main point you should remember in this lecture is The connections of the biological neuron are modeled in artificial neural networks as weights between nodes.
